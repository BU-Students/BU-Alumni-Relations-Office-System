# BU-Alumni-Relations-Office-System
### A content-management system for Bicol University Alumni Relations Office

## Folder descriptions
- `/admin` folder - here's where all admin-related files are placed
- `/data` folder - where the websites' data are placed
- `/main` folder - where all the end-users' website files are placed
- `/vendor` folder - this is where third-party libraries and frameworks used in our system are placed

## Things to re-check and fix before proceeding on improving the existing codebase
- In the process of re-organizing the file structure, were there any path-related errors encountered regarding the module you're developing? If so, please prioritize fixing it.
- Make sure the databse structure on your local machine is updated. (The initially current database's `.sql` file is provided.)

*NOTE: On the same directory level as `/admin`, `/data`, and `/main`, there's another directory named `/vendor` and should supossedly contain the following sub-directories:*
- `Highcharts-5.0.14/`
- `parsedown-master/`
- `sparksuite-simplemde-markdown-editor-6abda7a/`

*However, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to upload the source codes of the said 3rd-party frameworks to this repository, so instead I'll just be uploading a zip file containing those files in [our facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1398253680265313/1465062910251056/). Alternatively, you can download the source codes from their website (links provided below). Just keep in mind that the folder structure and its folder names should be the same.*
